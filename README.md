# Programming-a-Word-Game-Using-Python

This was a mini-project I worked on in a graduate-level Statistical computing class I took in undergrad. 
We had to implement a version of a scrabble-like word game using python. 
The first part of the project involved first implementing the word game from the framework. 
The second part of the project was to additionally implement a computer player using Monte Carlo simulations.
