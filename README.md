# Programming-a-Word-Game-Using-Python

This was a mini-project I worked on in a graduate-level Statistical computing class I took in undergrad. 
We had to implement a version of a scrabble-like word game using python. 
The first part of the project involved first implementing the word game from the framework (ps2.py). 
The second part of the project was to implement a computer player within the same word game using Monte Carlo simulations (ps3a.py). 
Additionally, the second part also had us write our own unit tests to test the functions that programmed for the computer player (ps3b.py).
